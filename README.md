# *Into the Under Game* Hub

## What it is
*Into the Under* is a 2d python game I began building in late December of 2025 that mixes elements of Minecraft and Super Mario Brothers into a block based exploration game with some new twists! I have been wanting to find a way to distribute it, and a website is a perfect way to do that.

## Features of the *Into the Under* Game Hub

### Game Download Page
The Game Download page will allow the user to select a version of *Into the Under* and download it to their computer

### Game Details and Live Count Page
A page will be included that tells users about what the game is and includes a live and actively updating count of how many users have downloaded *Into the Under*!

### Community Voting Page
It would be fun for users to be able to suggest features and vote on other user's suggestions. The community suggestions will be able to be voted to the top and have a higher chance of making it in the game.

### Seed Sharing
Similar to the Community Voting Page, but this page will allow users to share world generation seeds that they found fun to play! Users can also upvote seeds they found entertaining!
